    In a certain CTF competition, the solution records for some challenges have been lost. You need to recover the solution records; otherwise, 2045 will eat your head!

  2045 is very benevolent and acts as a spell Oracle for you to use, but 2045 may not always give the correct answer – that's how capricious it is!

  However, 2045 is full of love deep inside. Try using this magical spell, and perhaps you can escape the predicament!

  The syntax rules for the spells are:

  CX: Ask the X-th person if they solved the challenge, returning Yes/No.

  CX love CY: A mysterious magical spell of unknown use.

  Words that can be used in the spell:

  1.{C0, C1, ..., CN} represents N+1 CTF players.

  2."(" and ")".

  3.The magical spell "love".

  Note: Each word must be separated by a space, including "(" and ")".

  There are several players at the competition site, and you can ask 2045 a limited number of questions.
